# RSS-Plots
Set of functions to parse historical (PRISM and GridMET) data and CMIP5 (MACA) projections, create data tables, and plot visualizations.

Steps of analysis are in different folders:
1. Historical trends
2. Climate Futures
3. Drought
5. Summary tables
4. Summary plots

Water balance is a step as well, but in its own repository. 

Create branch for conducting analyses on a new park. If make generalizable improvements to script (e.g., bias correction improvements, new plots), commit to master. If embellishments that are specific or one-off, add to Variations repo.
